# document-templates
Personal templates for different kinds of documents for research work. Feel free to use.

## document types 
[wp] - working paper: Document for daily working. It's more like a diary and NOT a research paper for official publication. So content is mainly headwords and ideas. It can be chronological by date and perhaps wrong.
